#Operator

  # Operator: Arithmetic Operators

# Initialize variables
x1 = 10
x2 = 5

# Arithmetic operations
print(x1 + x2)  # Addition
print(x1 - x2)  # Subtraction
print(x1 * x2)  # Multiplication
print(x1 / x2)  # Division
print(x1 % x2)  # Modulus
print(x1 ** x2) # Exponentiation

#comparison operator
# Initialize variables
x = 10
y = 20

# Comparison operators
print(x == y)  # Equal to
print(x != y)  # Not equal to
print(x > y)   # Greater than
print(x < y)   # Less than
print(x >= y)  # Greater than or equal to
print(x <= y)  # Less than or equal to

if x>y:
  print("x is greater than y")

for i in range(5):
    if i < 3:
        print(f"{i} is less than 3")

#logical operator and or not
x=10
y=6
print((x>y)and (y<8))#this will pruint true or false ,here both condition should trtue

print((x>y) or (y<8))#this will pruint true or false ,here at least one condition should true


print(not(x > 5)) #false becaus x is greater than 5
